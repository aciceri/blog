        <p>I’ve just attended my first sprint, that is a kind of long hackathon, in this
case lasting 5 days and exclusively Nix themed.</p>
<p>I had the occasion to meet a variety of people with different attitudes to
problems and different backgrounds, this last thing was really interesting for
me since I think that in the last months I’ve lived inside a bubble made of
exclusively Haskellers.</p>

<p>Personally I’ve decided to devote most of my time on Nix internals since it’s
something that could help with the creation of new “2nix” tools (in the last
months I had many headaches due to tools like <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix">haskell.nix</a> and their extensive
use of IFDs). My colleague <a href="https://github.com/brainrake">Márton</a> and me also had a call with <a href="https://github.com/Ericson2314">John Ericson</a> which
let to <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/7339">this PR</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also spent a day digging into <span class="spurious-link" target="git@github.com:NixOS/hydra.git"><em>Hydra</em></span> trying to make it show the evaluation
log during the evaluation itself and not only after that the evaluation
terminated. In the end I wasn’t able to make it work (it was more difficult than
I initially thought) but it was an useful experience and perhaps in the future
I’ll continue these efforts.</p>
<p>Other people worked on different projects like making secure boot work on NixOS,
on nixifing a live coding environment, on <a href="https://github.com/OceanSprint/tesh">this</a> really interesting project about
making shell snippets in markdown testable, on <a href="https://github.com/oxalica/nil">nil</a> (a really powerful LSP server
for Nix written in Rust) or also <a href="https://github.com/hsjobeki/noogle">noogle</a>, a <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> like engine for Nix.</p>
