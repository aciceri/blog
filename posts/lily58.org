To be honest I built this keyboard the last summer, I took pictures with the
idea of documenting the process in a post but I never felt like it, until now,
and now I obviously forgot a lot of details I wanted to write down.

The keyboard is a [[https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58][Lily58]], a "6*4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard", I only
found the normal version, not "Pro". Since a split keyboard wasn't enough I've
also decided to use blank caps.
The reason behind this choice was that I was not sure about the layout when I
ordered the parts, and since it was a long time that I wanted to learn to blind
type I thought it would have been convenient.
I have to partially change my mind, I spent some days using sites like [[https://www.keybr.com/][keybr]] to
improve my skills but as soon I need more unusual symbols (not the characters in
short) I've difficulties.

Then, when in September I needed to type efficiently and I abondoned this
keyboard.
In conclusion, in hindsight, it would have been better to choose a less exotic
keyboard, I would had more satisfaction.



** Parts
   
I found out that trying to get the parts as European citzen is not easy, there's
little choice an the prices are high. I didn't find any Italian resellers for
this kind of stuff.

However in the end I ordered the needed parts from
- [[https://mechboards.co.uk/][MechBoards]] for the PCB, the diodes, the buttons, the TRRS cable (and
  connectors) and the acrylic case.
- [[https://www.aliexpress.com/store/429151][this store]] on AliExpress for the switches, the keycaps and the Pro Micros.

Usually I don't like to advertise for free, but this time I'm happy to do it
because the both the stores were really kind. The first one resent me a piece I
accidentaly broke and the second one let me personalize my order with the two
central 1.5U grey keys.

The total cost was about 120 euros, shipping included.
However I've some leftovers, some caps and switches, I could build a useless
numpad.

*** Case, cable, buttons and connectors

The case is in acrylic and it's transparent, had a protection film that made me
really satisfied when I removed it.

With the case I also got the TRSS cable and two females connectors.

Obviously with the case there were also the needed screws and some rubber pads,
however in the end I used other pads I already had because they were higher.

*** The PCBs

The two PCBs are identicals and they work differently depending on the side you
sold components on, an ingenious and cost-effective design.

*** A sleepy watchdog

My trusty watchdog oversaw and certified the entire procedure.
